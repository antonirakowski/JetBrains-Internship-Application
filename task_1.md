## Motivation

As a data science student who aspires to work in academia and 
has a deep appreciation for theoretical grounding, this project
strongly resonates with my goals and ambitions. 

## Current Research

I am currently involved in a bioinformatics project focused on
**molecular modelling in drug discovery**. As I lack a formal
background in biology and chemistry, I've independently 
studied relevant research papers under the guidance of my professor.
Thus, I gained firsthand experience of how difficult it is to access and interpret biological datasets and literature — 
a challenge this project aims to address.

Moreover, as of right now, I am working on a 
**NLP-based classification problem**, which
enhanced my skills in processing unstructured and 
noisy text — a vitally important aspect of 
extracting meaningful data from abstracts, titles, etc. 

## Past Research

In the past I have conducted research and data analysis
on various topics such as:

1. The drug epidemic in the USA
2. The effect of weather on power production and consumption

All these projects, both past and present, reinforced my regard
for tools that streamline research and data accessibility — especially in interdisciplinary fields.

## Skills 

1. I have a significant grasp of theoretical mathematics — calculus, linear algebra, discrete mathematics, probability, statistics, formal logic and set theory.

2. Proficient in Python, R, and Java.

3. I am meticulous, detail-oriented and tenacious.

4. Comfortable working both in teams and independently.

5. Confident in public speaking and presentations.

6. I thrive under deadlines and pressure.

7. I am familiar with LaTeX.

8. Experienced in working with APIs.

9. Experienced in working with relational databases, particularly proficient in MS SQL.

10. Experienced in research, data manipulation, data cleaning, data preprocessing, data visualisation, and feature engineering.

11. Experienced in building interactive web applications focused on intuitive and user-friendly data visualization (while I have used Shiny, as opposed to Flask, I’m comfortable picking up frameworks quickly and am eager to explore it if needed).

The above skill set allows me to contribute and be of value
to the project.

## Alignment

I perceive this internship to be a meaningful opportunity
to contribute scientific discovery via the development
of research-supporting tools.

It aligns perfectly with my academic aspirations, 
scientific interests, skills, passions and beliefs. I am eager to
apply my machine learning, data science and programming 
skills to make research swifter, more reliable, credible and effective.
