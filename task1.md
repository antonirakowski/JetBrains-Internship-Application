## Motivation

As a data science student aspiring to work in academia, this project aligns perfectly with my interests and career goals.

## Current Research

- I am involved in a bioinformatics project (molecular modelling in drug discovery) that bridges computer science and molecular biology. 
Since I lack formal education in biology, I had to conduct independent and extensive research. Through this experience, I have gained firsthand knowledge of the challenges researchers face.
- Additionally, I am working on an NLP-based classification project.  

## Past Projects
 
In the past, I have worked on project requiring research on topics such as:

- The drug epidemic in the USA  
- Power consumption and production

These experiences have reinforced my appreciation for tools that streamline research processes by improving data accessibility and organization.

## Project Fit

I am particularly excited about the opportunity to contribute to this project, as it not only aligns with my interests in data science,  
machine learning, and academia but also has the potential to significantly advance interdisciplinary research.  

Integrating machine learning with biology is one of the most promising frontiers in science and technology, enabling simulations and analyses that would be otherwise infeasible or prohibitively expensive in a laboratory setting. An example of which are virtual screenings, docking simulations, protein structure prediction algorithms 

I am to excited help create a tool that enhances  
the efficiency and accuracy of research.
